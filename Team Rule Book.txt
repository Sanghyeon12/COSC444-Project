--Branch & Git workflow rule--

No one pushes directly to main

	All changes go through feature branches - Pull Request - Review - merge.

Starting work(creating your branch):

git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/<yourname>

ex)feature/Jun


working, committing, pushing:
git status                      # See changed files
git add <files>                 # Or: git add .
git commit -m "[io] implement basic FASTA reader"
git push -u origin feature/<area>-<short-description>

When you want to merge main to your branch(when you want to update latest code in your branch):
git checkout main 		#check any change in main
git pull origin main		#Bring latest version of code
git checkout feature/<yourname>
git merge main
git push

--Pull Requests--
When to open a PR
	when a small feature or logical chunk of work is complete
	when tests pass(at least for the files you touched)

PR base / compare
base: main
compare: your feature branch, for example feature/Jun

PR description template
## Summary
- What you implemented or changed.
- Which part of the system it belongs to.

## Changes
- `src/...`: short description of changes
- `tests/...`: tests you added/updated

## Testing
- Commands you ran, e.g.:
  - `pytest tests/test_io.py`
  - manual run: `python -m src.main ...`

You guys don't need to specifically write above. Just think simple. What was did you change or what did you touched in this branch etc...

Professor said we can use ChatGpt as much as we can but still it should be readable Python(meaningful function and variable names, small functions with single responsibilities etc...)
So please do not use gpt as much as possible.(Please ask to teammates or prof or classmates)


And for Merge branch again...
DO NOT PUSHES DIRECTLY TO MAIN. ALL CHANGES GO THROUGH FEATURE BRANCHES(YOUR NAME'S BRANCH)
EX)FEATURE/JUN
THIS MEAN WHEN YOU CODING PLEASE WORKING IN YOU NAME'S BRANCH NOT IN THE MAIN BRANCH
